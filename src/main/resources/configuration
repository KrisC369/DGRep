#    -the first port to listen on for UDP packets.
#    -the last port to listen on for UDP packets. (All ports in between will be listened on)     
#    -the listening address on the localhost. (This specifies the interface.
#    -A demarcation line containing at least one '#'character.
#    -A list of hosts to broadcast the recieved UDP packets to. One line per host.
#   
#   For example: 
#       3332
#       3336
#       192.168.0.7
